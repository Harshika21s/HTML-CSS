## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simplified yet informative overview of how the World Wide Web functions. It explains fundamental concepts like clients, servers, protocols, and the role of various components in delivering web content to users.

## Key Concepts

- Clients and Servers
- Internet Connection
- TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
- DNS (Domain Name System)
- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)
- Component Files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Images, etc.)

## How the Web Works

The webpage introduces the process of viewing a webpage in a web browser. It highlights the interaction between clients and servers, and how various components collaborate to deliver web content.

## Order of Execution

The page outlines the order of execution when a user enters a web address:

1. The browser requests the real address (IP) of the hosting server from the DNS.
2. The browser sends an HTTP request to the server for the website's content.
3. If approved, the server sends data packets containing the website's files.
4. The browser assembles the data packets into a complete web page for display.

## DNS Resolution

Explains how the Domain Name System (DNS) acts as an address book, translating user-entered web addresses into IP addresses, allowing browsers to locate websites.

## Data Packets Transmission

Describes how data is transmitted across the internet in small packets, ensuring efficient and reliable delivery to clients.
